DataPipeline GUI 

Welcome to the DataPipeline GUI folder! This folder contains various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and associated files for running 
the data pipeline code, making it more user-friendly and accessible. These GUIs simplify the process of interacting with the data pipeline code and 
managing different types of databases.

Folder Contents:

CSV GUI: This subfolder contains the code for the GUI that allows you to interact with the data pipeline using CSV files as the database source.

MYSQL GUI: Within this subfolder, you will find the code for a GUI designed to work with the data pipeline, using MySQL databases as the source.

Py Files: This subfolder houses Python files that have been converted from Jupyter Notebook files to work seamlessly within the GUI environment.

SOP (Standard Operating Procedures): Here, you will find guidelines on how to effectively use the GUI for the data pipeline, ensuring that you can navigate and operate the interfaces with ease.


How to Use

	1) To make the most of the GUIs and associated files in this folder, follow these steps:

	2) Choose the GUI that is appropriate for your data pipeline needs, either the CSV GUI or the MYSQL GUI.

	3) Open the selected GUI using a Python interpreter or integrated development environment (IDE) compatible with GUI applications.

	4) Use the GUI to interact with the data pipeline code and manage your databases effectively.

	5) Refer to the SOP documentation for detailed instructions on how to navigate and utilize the GUI for various tasks.

Additional Information
	- The GUIs are designed to streamline and simplify the use of the data pipeline code, making it accessible to users who may not be familiar with command-line interfaces.

	- The SOP documentation provides clear and comprehensive instructions for using the GUI effectively, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

	- The Python files in the "Py Files" subfolder are meant to be run within the GUI environment, providing flexibility in working with your data.
