# CSV GUI

Welcome to the CSV GUI folder! This repository contains all the necessary assets and files to seamlessly interact with the data pipeline through a graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI enhances the user experience, providing a convenient and efficient way to manage and execute your data pipeline code.

## Folder Contents

### Assets
In the "Assets" subfolder, you'll discover various assets, including images like the logo. These assets are designed to improve the visual appeal and branding of the GUI.

### Pages
The "Pages" subfolder houses the Python code responsible for the GUI interface. Each file allows you to execute and manage different aspects of your data pipeline.

- **Home.py**: This Python file serves as the main entry point for the GUI application. It contains the core functionality, enabling you to run and manage your data pipeline effectively.

### GUI.bat
To simplify the process of launching the Streamlit application that hosts the GUI interface, we've provided the "GUI.bat" batch file. Running this file will start the Streamlit application, making it easy for you to navigate through the GUI.

## How to Use

1. **Run the GUI**
    - Execute the "GUI.bat" batch file to start the Streamlit application and launch the GUI interface.

2. **Navigate the GUI**
