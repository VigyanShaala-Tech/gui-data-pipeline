# DataPipeline GUI

Welcome to the DataPipeline GUI repository! This collection of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and associated files is designed to enhance the user-friendliness and accessibility of the data pipeline code. These GUIs simplify the interaction with the data pipeline and facilitate the management of different types of databases.

## Folder Contents:

### 1. scripts_csv
   - This subfolder contains the code for the GUI tailored for interacting with the data pipeline using CSV files as the database source.

### 2. scripts_mysql
   - Within this subfolder, you will find the code for a GUI specifically designed to work with the data pipeline using MySQL databases as the source.

### 3. py_files
   - Python files in this subfolder have been converted from Jupyter Notebook files to seamlessly operate within the GUI environment.

### 4. sop (Standard Operating Procedures)
   - Find guidelines here on how to effectively use the GUI for the data pipeline, ensuring seamless navigation and operation of the interfaces.

## How to Use:

1. **Choose the appropriate GUI:**
   - Select either the CSV GUI or the MYSQL GUI based on your data pipeline requirements.

2. **Open the GUI:**
   - Use a Python interpreter or integrated development environment (IDE) compatible with GUI applications to open the selected GUI.

3. **Interact with the Data Pipeline:**
   - Use the GUI to interact with the data pipeline code and efficiently manage your databases.

4. **Refer to SOP Documentation:**
   - Detailed instructions on how to navigate and utilize the GUI for various tasks are available in the SOP documentation.

## Additional Information:

- **User-Friendly Design:**
   - The GUIs are designed to streamline and simplify the use of the data pipeline code, making it accessible to users who may not be familiar with command-line interfaces.

- **Comprehensive SOP Documentation:**
   - The SOP documentation provides clear and comprehensive instructions for using the GUI effectively, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

- **Flexibility with Python Files:**
   - Python files in the "py_files" subfolder are meant to be run within the GUI environment, providing flexibility in working with your data.
